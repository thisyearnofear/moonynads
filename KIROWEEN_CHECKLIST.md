## 📝 Submission Text Template

### Project Description
```
Moonynads is a Frankenstein project that stitches together incompatible 
technologies: ASCII art from the 1970s meets Next.js 15, blockchain, and 
social protocols. It features an interactive animation lab with 7 animation 
modes, WebM recording, Monad L2 blockchain integration, and Farcaster Mini 
App support. Built with Kiro AI in 16 hours through vibe coding and 
spec-driven development.
```

### Kiro Usage Summary
```
Kiro was used extensively throughout development:

1. VIBE CODING: 7 major sessions generating ~5,000 lines of code through 
   natural conversation. Features like the animation system (800 lines) 
   and blockchain integration (1,200 lines) were built iteratively.

2. SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: Created 4 detailed technical specifications 
   before implementation, resulting in 50% faster development and higher 
   code quality.

3. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT: 22 major iterations across features, with Kiro 
   suggesting improvements and optimizations at each step.

4. DEBUGGING: Kiro helped solve complex integration issues, like the 
   Farcaster embed loading problem, saving ~3 hours of debugging time.

See .kiro/ directory for comprehensive documentation including vibe coding 
sessions, technical specs, and development timeline.
```

### Why This Wins
```
INNOVATION: Novel combination of vintage ASCII art with modern Web3 stack
COMPLEXITY: 7+ major systems integrated seamlessly (Next.js, Blockchain, 
            Farcaster, Canvas, Storage)
QUALITY: 60fps animations, graceful fallbacks, polished UX
KIRO USAGE: Comprehensive .kiro documentation (2,525 lines) showing vibe 
            coding + specs + iterations
STARTUP POTENTIAL: Real market, monetization strategy, scalable architecture
```
